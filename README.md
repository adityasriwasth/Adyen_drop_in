Aditya's Test Shop (A demo for Adyen's Drop-in solution)

In this project, I have created a simple shopping cart to process a payment using Adyen's drop-in solution. Adyen's drop-in solution aims to provide a simple and seamless integration in order to process payments for your online storefront.

This project was built using Python and Flask for the server, and HTML/CSS along with JS to render the frontend pages. 

I utilized the Python SDK provided by Adyen as a starting point to build this program. This SDK can be found here: https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-python-online-payments

To start the program, these are the requirements and installation steps:
